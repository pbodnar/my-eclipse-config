My Eclipse Config
=================

This project contains Eclipse settings files for various stuff,
which could possibly come handy to at least a bunch of Eclipse users. ;)

**Please read the remarks within the individual files before using them.**

Regarding the `*.epf` files, these contain selected Eclipse preferences,
which can be applied to a running Eclipse instance via the "File > Import... > Preferences"
dialog.

Tip: Don't be afraid if there is no preference listed after entering an `*.epf`
file to the import wizard. That's just the "Eclipse way" of letting you know that
the preferences from that file don't belong to any specific "preferences category"
known to Eclipse.
